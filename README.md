Grunt Demo
================================

Small demo of Grunt.js I made for a course I held about web development. 
The purpose of the demo is to show common used tasks in an easy way.

The demo includes a (very) small web project and a Gruntfile to build it for "production". A live version of the generated project can be found <a href="http://grunt-ftw.appspot.com/demo/index.html">here</a>

Included tasks
-------------------------
* grunt-contrib-jshint
* grunt-contrib-clean
* grunt-contrib-copy
* grunt-contrib-concat
* grunt-contrib-uglify
* grunt-contrib-htmlmin
* grunt-usemin
