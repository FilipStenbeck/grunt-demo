Grunt Demo
================================

Small demo of Grunt.js I made for a presentation I held about web development tooling. 
The purpose of the demo is to show common used tasks in an easy way.

The demo includes
--------------------------
* Watching for changes in CoffeScript files and compiling them on demand
* Building for production compile, jshint, minification and copying files
* Testing using Jasmine and Karma test runner

The demo includes a (very) small web project and a Gruntfile to test and build it for "production". A live version of the generated project can be found <a href="http://grunt-ftw.appspot.com/demo/index.html">here</a>

Included tasks
-------------------------
* grunt-contrib-jshint
* grunt-contrib-clean
* grunt-contrib-copy
* grunt-contrib-concat
* grunt-contrib-uglify
* grunt-contrib-htmlmin
